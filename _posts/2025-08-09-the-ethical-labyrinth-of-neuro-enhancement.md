In recent years, there has been a remarkable rise in the number of startups focusing on neuroenhancement technologies. These innovative companies are applying the power of science and technology to push the boundaries of human cognitive performance. Actually people have always dreamed of having smarter and faster brains. From old herbal remedies to modern-day pills and future brain links, the goal of making our brains better than they naturally are is becoming real. But as science moves ahead, big ethical problems come up. These new technologies could change our future in amazing ways. However, they also bring up serious questions about fairness, safety and who we are.

#### Inequality and the "Upgraded" Class
If brain enhancement is expensive and hard to get, only the wealthy may benefit. This could create a society where the rich not only have better opportunities but also better memory, focus and creativity. The rest could be left behind, making the gap between rich and poor even bigger.

#### Pressure to Enhance
Even if brain enhancement starts as a choice, it could quickly turn into an expectation. Students, athletes or workers might feel they have to "upgrade" just to keep up. Saying "no" might no longer feel like a real option. Is it truly a choice if you'll fall behind without it?

#### Staying Yourself
Brain enhancement can affect more than memory or attention, it can change personality, motivation and creativity. That raises deep questions:
- Are you still "you" if technology changes how you think or feel?
- If a writer uses brain tech to boost creativity, who gets the credit?
- Does removing natural limits take away the meaning of human achievement?

#### Safety and Unknown Risks
We still don't know enough about the long-term effects of brain enhancement. Drugs, electrical stimulation or genetic changes could have unexpected side effects, especially in young people. Once changes are made, some may be impossible to undo. How do we keep people safe while still making progress?

#### Who's in Control?
Who should make the rules for brain enhancement? Without strong laws, the risks grow:
- Companies might track workers' thoughts or moods
- Governments could use brain tech for control or surveillance
- Military use could push people beyond safe limits

With no doubt, reliable studies carried out with no prejudice on effects of neuroenhancement in healthy subjects will be helpful in clarifying some, if not all issues. If it were acceptable or not to expand our cognitive and emotional abilities up to the point of scrambling our authenticity is a question requiring an integrated approach from specialists of different disciplines, from psychology to psychiatry, philosophy, religion, social and political science.

So we're left with one question: are we ready for the world that neuro enhancement will create?
