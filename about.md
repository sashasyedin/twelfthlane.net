<div class="row-fluid">
	<p>
		Hi there, I'm Alexander, a software developer living and working in St Petersburg/Helsinki.
		While having a full-time job, I still find time to get other stuff done, like more coding!
		Moreover, I love rock-n-roll, football, Linux and a good IPA, in roughly that order.
	</p>
	<p>
		From time to time I write blog posts on what I'm working on, topics that interest me or just share some thoughts on life, <s>death and immortality</s>.
